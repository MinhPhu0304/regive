# Regive
> The opportunity to give unconditionally.

This is the build repository for Regive, and the README summarizes the Regive Platform. Please find the Regive Platform repos, installation/build instructions and technical details at https://github.com/anthonywongnz/regive. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## 4. Project Description

## What's the problem?

Constantly, people tend to purchase things that they don’t necessarily need and we end up with a lot of materialistic items. 

During the lockdown individuals stuck at home were able to sort through items they no longer wanted or needed, but with restrictions in place, there was no place to take them. Garage sales were not an option for those trying to maintain social distancing. This led to many communities closing charity stores and cancelling citywide garage sales. 

Many charity organisations that run Op shops (known as "Thrift Shops" in the USA and "Recycle Stores" in parts of Asia) are informally reporting unprecedented volume of donations while restrictions lossen. As a result was a surplus of items. 

Rather than overflowing Charity Organisations or by selling and attempting to earn a bit of monetary value, we could learn to regive our beloved items to others who may be in need of it.


## How can technology help?

Regive is a platform that connects an individual with their local community, charities and organisations that have a variety of items to regive away to those who are seeking for it.

## The Idea 


## Regive works by 

1.       The Recipient user launches the Regive app and can access information across multiple services.
2.       The Recipient user answers a small survey. 
3.       The Supplier (Donator) can post the items that they are donating, as well as arrange pickup/delivery and payment options.
4.       The Recipient user can select the item that they need. 
5.       The Recipient user and Supplier finalises pickup/delivery and payment options.

## 6. Getting Started
<a name="started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
